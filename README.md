## DDL To Load

```
create table persons (
    id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name STRING
);
```

## Issues

1. myBatis wraps all exceptions as RuntimeExceptions, and a single type at that.
   So client side is unable to distinguish directly but must peel back the onion
   to see the causation.
